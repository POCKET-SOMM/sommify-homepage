      We are creating an <b>artificial intelligence sommelier</b> making quality
      pairings accessible. The AI somm is built on the world-class wine
      knowledge of Julie Dupouy and it will be packaged as an API. The API will
      be able to populate meals on apps and websites with the right wines or
      their silhouettes. To find out how we can <b>sommify</b> your digital wine
      experience, download our <a href='#ugauga'>deck</a>.
