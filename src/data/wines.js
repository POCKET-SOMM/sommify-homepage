      text: 'Sparkling wines made using the traditional method are served well-chilled, at 8–12°C. Fresh, crisp sparkling wines are served slightly cooler, at 6–8°C. A sparkling wine stopper will keep the bubbles in the bottle for several days, as long as the bottle is stored in the fridge. The fuller the bottle, the longer the bubbles will last. Using a gel cooler stored in the freezer, you can chill a bottle from room temperature to the perfect serving temperature in about 20 minutes. In a large cooler or bucket filled with ice cubes and water, you can chill a bottle in 15 minutes.',
